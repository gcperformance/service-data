The data for this indicator is from the annual Sustainability Survey for Fisheries managed by NFP. The indicator’s denominator is the total number of major fish stocks tracked through the survey (Healthy or Cautious + Uncertain) in any given year and the numerator is the number of major stocks in the Healthy or Cautious zones. Between 2014-15 and 2018-19 the number of fish stocks with an Uncertain status has increased from 27 (or 17% of the total stocks) to 73 (41% of the total stocks).  This increase is attributed to changes in the survey tool, as well as an increased rigour around data collection including the validation of survey results. The validation of the survey data after it’s been received led to stocks switching from being in the Healthy or Cautious zone, to an Uncertain status. This validation has resulted in a better understanding of the true status of stocks overtime and an accompanying change to the target to reflect this new “baseline”.","The variance between planned and actual spending is primarily due to funding that will be spent in future years in order to meet program requirements."

In addition to revenues from assessments, FCAC receives an annual statutory expenditure of a maximum of $5,000,000 to support the financial literacy of Canadians. 

FCAC’s total expenses for fiscal year 2019-20 were $30.6 million, an increase of $5.0 million, or 19% compared to the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to increases in personnel costs, information costs and professional services related to the implementation of new legislation, which created a stronger federal Financial Consumer Protection Framework (FCPF).

Personnel costs, FCAC’s largest expense, rose by $2.8 million, or 16%. The increase is a result of growth required to support the implementation of the new FCPF, a new supervision framework, and a more comprehensive approach to supervision and enforcement. Furthermore, FCAC completed the repatriation of human resources and finance functions that allowed the Agency to operate more efficiently and reduce costs. Information costs increased by $0.7 million mainly due to its advertising campaign, which focused primarily on home equity lines of credit. Professional services increased by $0.4 million mainly as a result of expenses incurred for the modernization of the Agency’s business systems and processes. All other expenses, in total, increased by $1.1 million.

The Office of the Correctional Investigator is one of many oversight agencies that exist to provide independent assurance to Canadians and parliamentarians that the delivery of federal services and programs is done in an open, transparent and accountable manner. The notion of righting a wrong is central to the Ombudsman role. An Ombudsman exists to provide independent, objective perspective on the fairness of government services – to counterbalance the relative strength of public institutions against the individual. A successful ombudsman is one who increases public confidence in public administration. To that end, the Office of the Correctional Investigator provides access to every federal offender to our Ombudsman services via the investigation of individual complaints and systemic concerns.  Recommendations to the Correctional Service of Canada are non-binding. On this point, it is imperative that the organization and its program not become just another management component of the body it is mandated by law to oversee. If the organization is to remain effective, the public and government must see the role as independent and impartial.","In fiscal 2019-20, nearly all positions in OCI were staffed for the first time.

•	The threat of, and Government of Canada’s response to, foreign interference and influence activities.  This review analyzes a contemporary threat to the rights and freedoms of Canadians and Canadian society and institutions. It also examines the government’s response to foreign interference through the lens of Canadian Fundamental Institutions (CFIs) to assess the government’s strategy to protect CFIs.

•	The Canada Border Services Agency’s (CBSA’s) national security and intelligence activities. This review marks the first independent, external review of the national security and intelligence activities of the CBSA. This review seeks to establish a baseline of knowledge on the agency’s role in the security and intelligence community, its authorities to conduct national security and intelligence activities, and the existing governance and oversight structures surrounding these activities. 

•	Diversity and inclusion in the security and intelligence community. This review examines the degree of representation of designated groups (women, Aboriginal people, persons with disabilities, and members of visible minority groups) within organizations in the security and intelligence community. It also considers the goals, initiatives, programs and measures that departments and agencies have taken to address inclusion. 

For its special report, the Committee is reviewing the collection, use, retention and dissemination of information on Canadians in the context of the Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces (DND/CAF) defence intelligence activities.

All other expenditures will be attributed to the Core Responsibility. While these adjustments will provide greater clarity in the longer term, they have resulted in shorter-term variances, such as the differences in planned and actual spending for Internal Services and the breakdown of the organization’s human resources profile.

During the 2019-20 reporting period, all FTEs are captured under the Core Responsibility. Similar to 2018-19, the Secretariat seconded legal counsel for part of the year. This individual's responsibilities included supporting a specific review and providing legal advice. These expenditures are captured under the Core Responsibility. As a result, the 4% increase in personnel under the Core Responsibility and the absence of personnel under Internal Services is attributable to this recording of counsel’s activities in 2019-20.

A strong, accessible and timely complaint process is essential to the credibility of both the Commission and the RCMP. The Commission has made use of leading-edge communication tools and online technology to provide Canadians with an accessible and efficient way to voice their concerns. The Commission has streamlined and simplified its online complaint process resulting in a significant increase in the number of complaints received online and improved processing times.
Through effective monitoring of the RCMP’s response to public complaints, as well as a robust review process that leads to findings and recommendations when necessary, the Commission aims to effect change and foster public confidence in the RCMP. By augmenting its internal capacity to conduct complaint reviews and independent investigations, gather and analyze relevant data, and track the manner in which its recommendations are accepted and implemented by the RCMP, the Commission adds credibility to the complaint and review processes.
In the fiscal 2020–21 period, the Commission will:
• Continue its refinement of the complaint and review intake processes.
• Continue to track actions taken by the RCMP with respect to recommendations contained in the Commission’s earlier reports.
• Enhance the Commission’s data collection, statistical integration, analysis and reporting functions.","Erratum note: Actual expenditure figure for this program is $4,741,493.46."

It is of paramount importance that the review of police conduct, policy and practice be conducted independently, particularly where an incident attracts wide public interest and there is a public perception that the RCMP may not be impartial in its investigation of the incident. In the fiscal 2020–21 period, the Commission will:
• Eliminate the backlog of review files.
• Reallocate resources to enable completion of review files within the Commission’s stated service standards.
• Continue the refinement of its major case management system and processes.
Conducting reviews of specified RCMP activities contributes to the increased transparency and public accountability of the RCMP. These reviews are supported by independent research and systemic examinations of policies, procedures and training, among other issues.
During the fiscal 2020–21 period, the Commission will complete its specified activity reviews of:
- RCMP use of strip searches;
- RCMP use of street checks;
- RCMP use of crime reduction units.

This increase is offset by a decrease in the actual spending of the Canada Learning Bond (CLB).

The actual number of new CLB beneficiaries was 20% lower than the projections for the fiscal year 2021 to 2022 (when the department expected a recovery). The drop was mainly driven by the extended slowdown in various activities required to get the CLB like applying for a Social Insurance Number, filing tax returns, opening a new RESP account, as well as by reduced promotion of the CLB."
