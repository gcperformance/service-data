In September 2004, the Agency was created within the federal Health  Portfolio to deliver on the Government of Canada’s commitment to  increase its focus on public health in order to help protect and improve  the health and safety of all Canadians and to contribute to strengthening  public health capacities across Canada.","Health",,,,"Departmental Agencies",2004,,"a","Public Health Agency of Canada Act, S.C. 2006, c. 5 Order-in-Council P.C. 2004-1068","I.1","IV",,,,"www.phac-aspc.gc.ca"
