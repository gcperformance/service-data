A strong, accessible and timely complaint process is essential to the credibility of both the Commission and the RCMP. The Commission has made use of leading-edge communication tools and online technology to provide Canadians with an accessible and efficient way to voice their concerns. The Commission has streamlined and simplified its online complaint process resulting in a significant increase in the number of complaints received online and improved processing times.
Through effective monitoring of the RCMP’s response to public complaints, as well as a robust review process that leads to findings and recommendations when necessary, the Commission aims to effect change and foster public confidence in the RCMP. By augmenting its internal capacity to conduct complaint reviews and independent investigations, gather and analyze relevant data, and track the manner in which its recommendations are accepted and implemented by the RCMP, the Commission adds credibility to the complaint and review processes.
In the fiscal 2020–21 period, the Commission will:
• Continue its refinement of the complaint and review intake processes.
• Continue to track actions taken by the RCMP with respect to recommendations contained in the Commission’s earlier reports.
• Enhance the Commission’s data collection, statistical integration, analysis and reporting functions.","Erratum note: Actual expenditure figure for this program is $4,741,493.46."

It is of paramount importance that the review of police conduct, policy and practice be conducted independently, particularly where an incident attracts wide public interest and there is a public perception that the RCMP may not be impartial in its investigation of the incident. In the fiscal 2020–21 period, the Commission will:
• Eliminate the backlog of review files.
• Reallocate resources to enable completion of review files within the Commission’s stated service standards.
• Continue the refinement of its major case management system and processes.
Conducting reviews of specified RCMP activities contributes to the increased transparency and public accountability of the RCMP. These reviews are supported by independent research and systemic examinations of policies, procedures and training, among other issues.
During the fiscal 2020–21 period, the Commission will complete its specified activity reviews of:
- RCMP use of strip searches;
- RCMP use of street checks;
- RCMP use of crime reduction units.
Results of these reviews, launched in 2018, will be made public in fiscal 2020–21.","Erratum note: Actual expenditure figure for this program is $1,897,530.29."

CSLP is expecting to issue an additional $1.5B in grants during loan year 2020-2021 (August 2020 and July 2021). A part of the extra grants will be issued during fiscal year 2021-2022, explaining a variance of roughly $340M over fiscal year 2023-2024. The rest of the variance comes from the impact of this measure on the alternative payment to non-participating jurisdictions*. The full impact of doubling the grants will be accounted for in the calculation of the alternative payment for fiscal year 2021-2022. The Program expects an increase of roughly $295M in alternative payment due to the temporary doubling of grants measure. Together, the increase in grants ($340M) and the increase in alternative payment ($295M), explain the variance in planned spending between fiscal year 2021-2022 and 2023-2024. *The alternative payment is based on the Net cost of the CSLP Program and the pro rata of the population (18-24 y-old) in the non-participating jurisdictions versus the rest of Canada.","The variance between planned and actual spending is mainly due to the disbursement of Canada Student Grants (CSGs) that was $1.275 billion higher than planned. This higher disbursement is the result of the temporary doubling of CSGs during the pandemic.

This increase is offset by a decrease in the actual spending of the Canada Learning Bond (CLB). This is explained by the fact that the pandemic persisted longer than expected which had a significant impact on the number of CLB beneficiaries. The actual number of new CLB beneficiaries was 20% lower than the projections for the fiscal year 2021 to 2022 (when the department expected a recovery). The drop was mainly driven by the extended slowdown in various activities required to get the CLB like applying for a Social Insurance Number, filing tax returns, opening a new RESP account, as well as by reduced promotion of the CLB."

The reason for the decrease in the amount from 2022-23 to 2023-2024 is that 2023-2024 and future years do not include any operating budget carry-forward, only the Main Estimates.

The increase in funding is offset by a decrease in statutory authorities following adjustments made to align with actual expenditures, including adjustments to the Employee Benefits Plan; and an internal reallocation of funds to other programs in order to meet operational priorities as a result of lower than anticipated Government Assisted Refugees arrivals, lower than anticipated health services costs for resettled refugees as part of the Interim Federal Health Program, and lower than anticipated costs as the department achieved its target to resettle 40,000 Afghan refugees."

**Planned FTEs**
The decrease in the planned FTEs from 2024-25 to 2025-26 is mainly attributable to the decrease of personnel funding for the Passport Program in projects and investments as a results of implementation of current in-flight projects planned for 2024-25.","The variance is attributable to lower than anticipated revenues as a result of a decrease in travel document requests compared to the forecast established in October 2023 as well as an increase in remission payments on service fees due to the non-compliance of service standards for the passport delivery. Furthermore, an increase in volumes was forecasted for the year, but a revision of the volumes was done and predicted a greater increase. This necessitated incurring additional service delivery costs to meet the expected demand, resulting in a larger than expected annual deficit. Finally, the cost reductions planned through automation and mitigation measures did not generate the anticipated savings.

The surpluses recorded in previous years allow the deficit in 2024-25 to be absorbed, but the passport revolving fund remain in a precarious financial situation having achieved a larger annual deficit than expected."

FTEs: Funding was extended to the end of fiscal year 2025–26 for Service Excellence initiatives, which was originally part of the Government’s Economic and Fiscal Snapshot in August 2020. In addition to this initiative, we have also extended funding for 2 years (to the end of 2025–26) to maintain frontline staffing levels, including the Case Manager to Veteran ratio, and upgrade the tools Case Managers use – freeing up more time for them to work directly with Veterans. This funding will end after 2025–26 fiscal year. Case Management Renewal temporary funding begins in 2025–26 aimed at enhancing and modernizing case management services for Veterans until the end of 2026–27. While funding for human resource levels may return to reduced levels (from prior to Service Excellence and Case Management Renewal) in 2027–28, we will continue to reassess our long term capacity as we move forward in improving service to Veterans and their families.",

Fiscal year 2025–26 represents the last full year of temporary funding, leading to a slight reduction in planned spending for 2026–27 as funding begins to wind down. By 2027–28, planned spending is reduced to align with the Committee’s permanent reference levels. However, the planned spending amount is significantly higher than previous years due to reprofiled funding from previous fiscal years, which is been carried forward to address the costs related for the workplace colocation project.

The planned FTEs for the next three fiscal years align with the temporary funding received from the Department of National Defence. This temporary funding supports workforce needs through 2025–26 and 2026–27, with a slight reduction beginning in 2027–28 as FTE levels return to align with the organization’s baseline budget.",
